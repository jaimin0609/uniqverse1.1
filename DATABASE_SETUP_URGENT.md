# 🚀 DATABASE SETUP GUIDE - CRITICAL FIX REQUIRED

## ⚠️ Current Issue
Your Vercel deployment is failing because **no tables exist in your Supabase database**. The error about "prisma://" protocol is misleading - it's actually because Prisma can't find the expected tables.

## 🔧 IMMEDIATE SOLUTION

### Step 1: Open Supabase SQL Editor
1. Go to your Supabase dashboard: https://supabase.com/dashboard
2. Select your project
3. Navigate to **SQL Editor** from the left sidebar

### Step 2: Run the Migration
1. Open the file `migration.sql` (generated in your project root)
2. Copy ALL the contents (1500+ lines)
3. Paste into the Supabase SQL Editor
4. Click **RUN** to execute the migration

### Step 3: Verify Tables Created
1. Go to **Table Editor** in Supabase dashboard
2. You should now see all tables including:
   - User
   - Product
   - Order
   - Category
   - Cart
   - And many more...

### Step 4: Redeploy to Vercel
1. Go to your Vercel dashboard
2. Find your project deployment
3. Click **Redeploy** (or push a new commit to trigger deployment)

## 📋 What the Migration Creates

The migration will create:
- **24 Enum types** (UserRole, OrderStatus, PaymentStatus, etc.)
- **50+ Tables** with all relationships
- **Primary keys, foreign keys, and indexes**
- **Default values and constraints**

## 🔍 Why This Happened

1. Your Prisma schema is correct ✅
2. Your environment variables are set ✅
3. But the database tables were never created ❌

When Prisma tries to access tables during build/runtime, it fails because they don't exist, causing the deployment to fail.

## ✅ After Running Migration

Once you run the migration in Supabase:
1. All tables will exist
2. Vercel deployment will succeed
3. Your site will be fully functional
4. Database operations will work correctly

## 🆘 If You Need Help

If you encounter any issues:
1. Check the Supabase SQL Editor for error messages
2. Ensure you copied the ENTIRE migration.sql file
3. Verify your DATABASE_URL is correct in Vercel environment variables

The migration is safe to run and will not affect any existing data (since the database is currently empty).
