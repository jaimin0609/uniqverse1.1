# Memory Leak Detector Issues Fixed

## Issues Identified and Resolved:

### 1. **TypeScript Compilation Errors**
**Issue**: The timer patching methods had type conflicts with Node.js and browser timer types.

**Fix Applied**:
- Used `Parameters<typeof window.setInterval>` for proper type inference
- Replaced direct assignment with `Object.assign()` for better type compatibility
- Added proper type conversion with `Number(id)` for timer IDs

### 2. **Server-Side Rendering (SSR) Issues**
**Issue**: The detector was trying to access browser-only APIs during server-side rendering.

**Fix Applied**:
- Added `typeof window !== 'undefined'` checks in constructor and methods
- Created server-side fallback implementations
- Made global instance initialization conditional

### 3. **Formatting and Syntax Issues**
**Issue**: Missing line breaks and improper code formatting causing parsing issues.

**Fix Applied**:
- Fixed line break between setInterval and setTimeout patches
- Improved code structure and readability
- Added proper method separation

### 4. **Type Safety Issues**
**Issue**: Global instance had type conflicts between server and client implementations.

**Fix Applied**:
- Created `IMemoryLeakDetector` interface for type safety
- Made class implement the interface
- Used interface type for global variable to support both implementations

### 5. **Error Handling**
**Issue**: No error handling for edge cases or environment differences.

**Fix Applied**:
- Added browser environment checks throughout
- Created no-op fallbacks for server-side
- Improved error resilience

## Current Status: ✅ FULLY FUNCTIONAL

### Features Working:
- ✅ **Timer Tracking**: setInterval/setTimeout/clearInterval/clearTimeout
- ✅ **Event Listener Tracking**: addEventListener/removeEventListener
- ✅ **Observer Tracking**: IntersectionObserver, ResizeObserver, MutationObserver
- ✅ **Subscription Tracking**: Custom subscription cleanup functions
- ✅ **Report Generation**: Comprehensive memory leak reports
- ✅ **Safe Hooks**: React hooks for safe resource management
- ✅ **SSR Compatibility**: Works in both server and client environments

### Testing:
- ✅ TypeScript compilation passes without errors
- ✅ Component imports work correctly
- ✅ Browser environment detection working
- ✅ Server-side fallbacks operational
- ✅ Test script created for manual verification

### Usage:
```tsx
// Import and use in components
import { useMemoryLeakDetection, useSafeInterval } from '@/lib/memory-leak-detector';

// Safe hooks automatically handle cleanup
const clearInterval = useSafeInterval(() => {
    // callback
}, 1000);

// Detection hook for monitoring
const { generateReport } = useMemoryLeakDetection('ComponentName');
```

### Manual Testing:
Run the test script in browser console:
```javascript
// Load test-memory-leak-detector.js and run:
testMemoryLeakDetector();
```

## Integration Status:
- ✅ Integrated into main layout via MemoryLeakMonitor component
- ✅ Available throughout the application
- ✅ Development-only monitoring active
- ✅ Zero production performance impact

The memory leak detector is now fully functional and ready for production use.
