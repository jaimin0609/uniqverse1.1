## 🚀 Key Technical Achievements

### Pattern Matching Algorithm
```typescript
// Enhanced scoring with multiple match types
- Exact phrase match: 25 points
- Contains phrase match: 20 points  
- Word boundary match: 15 points
- Keyword clustering: 3-8 points
- 60% confidence minimum threshold
```

### Intelligent Query Classification
```typescript
// Blacklist prevents false matches
- Homework, math, cooking, weather, etc.

// Complex query detection for AI routing
- Multi-word product searches
- Recommendation requests
- Detailed inquiries
```

### Hybrid Response System
```typescript
// Pattern-first approach with AI fallback
1. Check blacklist → Redirect if needed
2. Try pattern matching → Use if confidence > 60%
3. Route to OpenAI → UniQVerse-focused prompts
4. Return intelligent response
```
