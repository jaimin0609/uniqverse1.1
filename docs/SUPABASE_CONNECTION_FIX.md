# Supabase Connection Fix - IPv4 Transition Issue

## Problem Overview
After migrating to Supabase's IPv6 infrastructure, we encountered prepared statement errors when using connection pooling:

```
Error: prepared statement "s0" already exists
ConnectorError: PostgresError { code: "42P05", message: "prepared statement \"s0\" already exists" }
```

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by Supabase's transition to IPv6, which can cause connection problems for networks that don't support IPv6 properly. This particularly affects:
- Connection pooling with PgBouncer
- Prepared statements management
- Client library connections

## Solution Applied
Updated the database connection string to use Supavisor (IPv4) with proper connection pooling parameters:

**Before:**
```env
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://postgres:password@db.project.supabase.co:5432/postgres"
```

**After:**
```env
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://postgres.project:password@aws-0-region.pooler.supabase.com:6543/postgres?pgbouncer=true&connection_limit=1"
```

### Key Changes:
1. **Used Supavisor endpoint**: `pooler.supabase.com` instead of direct `supabase.co`
2. **Added pgbouncer parameter**: `pgbouncer=true` to enable proper connection pooling
3. **Set connection limit**: `connection_limit=1` to prevent connection conflicts
4. **Used IPv4-compatible endpoint**: Ensures compatibility with networks without IPv6

## Implementation Steps
1. Updated `.env` file with new connection string
2. Regenerated Prisma client: `npx prisma generate`
3. Verified connection with test scripts
4. Updated database schema with enhanced commission fields
5. Tested all database operations

## Verification
- ✅ Database connections working without prepared statement errors
- ✅ Prisma queries executing successfully
- ✅ Connection pooling functioning correctly
- ✅ Enhanced commission system fully operational

## Alternative Solutions
If this approach doesn't work for your network:
1. **Configure network for IPv6**: Update network settings to support IPv6
2. **Purchase IPv4 addon**: Supabase offers IPv4 as a paid addon
3. **Use client libraries**: PostgREST or other client libraries may handle connection differently
4. **Switch to local development**: Use local PostgreSQL for development

## Files Cleaned Up
Removed debugging and test files created during troubleshooting:
- `check-database.js`
- `test-db-connection.js`
- `test-commission-service.js`
- `test-fixed-connection.js`
- `test-enhanced-commission*.js`
- `verify-migration-state.js`
- `run-*-migration.js`
- `supabase-connection-helper.js`
- Duplicate SQL migration files
