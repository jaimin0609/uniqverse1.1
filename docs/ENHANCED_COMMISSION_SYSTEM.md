### 2. Performance-Based System

#### **Performance Bonuses** (Up to 1.5% additional earnings)

- **Good Performers (Rating ‚â• 4.5, 20+ orders)**: 1% automatic discount

## How It Works

### 1. Commission Calculation Example

**Scenario**: $100 sale on Professional Plan
- **Base Commission**: $100 √ó 5% = $5.00
- **Transaction Fee**: $0.20
- **Performance Bonus**: +$0.50 (4.8 rating, 98% fulfillment)
- **Customer Discount**: -$2.00 (top performer benefit)

**Result**:
- **Vendor Earnings**: $100 - $5.00 - $0.20 + $0.50 = $95.30
- **Platform Earnings**: $5.00 + $0.20 - $0.50 = $4.70
- **Customer Saves**: $2.00

### 2. Plan Recommendations

The system automatically recommends the most cost-effective plan based on:
- Monthly sales volume
- Number of transactions
- Product count
- Performance metrics

**Example Recommendation Logic**:
```
IF monthly_sales > $10,000 AND orders > 100
    RECOMMEND Enterprise (save on commission)
ELSE IF monthly_sales > $2,000 AND orders > 20
    RECOMMEND Professional (balanced benefits)
ELSE
    RECOMMEND Starter (low risk)
```
