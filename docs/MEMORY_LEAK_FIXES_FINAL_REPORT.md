- ✅ **Memory Optimizer**: Proper interval management and cleanup

#### 5. **Hydration Issues**
- ✅ **Date Rendering**: Created `ClientDate` component for SSR/CSR compatibility
- ✅ **Admin Pages**: Updated categories, vendor-applications, users, suppliers pages
- ✅ **Layout Hydration**: Added `suppressHydrationWarning` to body tag

### New Prevention Tools Implemented:

#### 1. **Memory Leak Detector** (`src/lib/memory-leak-detector.tsx`)
- Global method patching for automatic tracking
- Safe hooks: `useSafeInterval`, `useSafeTimeout`, `useSafeEventListener`, `useSafeObserver`
- Comprehensive reporting system
- TypeScript-safe implementation

#### 2. **Memory Leak Monitor** (`src/components/debug/memory-leak-monitor.tsx`)
- Development-only runtime monitoring
- Automatic leak detection and reporting
- Visual toast notifications for detected leaks
- Tab visibility and navigation monitoring

#### 3. **Browser Analysis Script** (`public/memory-leak-analysis.js`)
- Manual console-based memory analysis
- Comprehensive interval/timeout tracking
- Event listener enumeration
- Memory usage analysis with Chrome's performance.memory API

#### 4. **Documentation** (`docs/MEMORY_LEAK_PREVENTION_GUIDE.md`)
- Complete prevention guide
- Best practices and patterns
- Emergency procedures
- Development monitoring instructions

### Integration Status:

#### ✅ **Active Monitoring**
- Memory leak monitor integrated into main layout
- Automatic detection runs every 30 seconds in development
- Console logging for all resource creation/cleanup
- Toast notifications for detected issues

#### ✅ **Development Tools**
- React DevTools integration
- Chrome DevTools memory analysis support
- Console scripts for manual analysis
- Comprehensive documentation

#### ✅ **Production Safety**
- All monitoring tools disabled in production builds
- Server-side intervals properly managed with environment checks
- No performance impact on production
- Cleanup functions available for emergency use

### Testing Verification:

#### ✅ **Component Testing**
All components verified to have proper cleanup:
- Timer-based components: Event showcase, promotion banner, performance dashboards
- Observer-based components: Infinite products, image optimization
- Event listener components: Header, cart drawer, toast listener
- Context providers: Currency provider with exchange rate polling

#### ✅ **Server Resource Testing**
All server-side resources verified:
- Environment-specific execution (`typeof window === 'undefined'`)
- Proper cleanup function exports
- Memory management in lib files

#### ✅ **Hydration Testing**
- No hydration mismatches detected
- Date rendering properly handled with ClientDate component
- suppressHydrationWarning applied where necessary

### Performance Impact:

#### **Development**
- Minimal overhead from monitoring tools
- Enhanced debugging capabilities
- Real-time leak detection

#### **Production**
- Zero performance impact (monitoring disabled)
- Clean resource management
- Optimized memory usage

### Final Recommendations:

1. **Keep monitoring active** during development
2. **Run analysis script** periodically in browser console
3. **Review console logs** for resource tracking
4. **Use safe hooks** for new components requiring timers/listeners/observers
5. **Follow cleanup patterns** documented in the guide

### Emergency Procedures:

If memory leaks are detected in production:
1. Use browser analysis script for immediate assessment
2. Check specific components mentioned in leak reports
3. Apply emergency cleanup functions from memory-optimizer
4. Review recent changes for missing cleanup code

## Result: Memory leak protection is now comprehensive and robust

The project now has:
- ✅ **Zero detected memory leaks** in current codebase
- ✅ **Automatic prevention** tools for future development
- ✅ **Real-time monitoring** in development environment
- ✅ **Comprehensive documentation** for maintenance
- ✅ **Emergency procedures** for production issues

All memory leak sources have been identified, fixed, and prevented with automated tooling.
