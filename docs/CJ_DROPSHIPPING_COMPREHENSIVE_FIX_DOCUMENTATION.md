## Issues Overview

The CJ Dropshipping integration had several main issues:

1. **Product ID Format Issue**: The API requires product IDs in a specific format (`pid:NUMBER:null`), but our implementation was only using the numeric part.
2. **URL Formatting Issue**: API calls were failing with "Interface not found" errors due to extra spaces in URL endpoint paths.
3. **Double-Prefix Issue**: After fixing the first issue, we encountered a new problem where IDs were being double-formatted, resulting in invalid formats like `pid:pid:NUMBER:null:null`.

## Fix 1: Product ID Format Handling

### Issue Details

The product import feature from CJ Dropshipping was failing with the error message:
```
"Failed to get product details: Product not found: pid:2505100714581619400:null"
```

### Root Cause

CJ Dropshipping's API expects product IDs in the format `pid:NUMBER:null`, but our code was extracting just the numeric part, causing API calls to fail.

### Solution Implemented

1. Added a new `formatProductId` utility method to the `CJDropshippingApiClient` class:
```javascript
private formatProductId(pid: string): string {
    // If it's already in the expected format, keep it as is
    if (/^pid:\d+:null$/.test(pid)) {
        return pid;
    }

    // If it's in the format "pid:number", add ":null"
    if (/^pid:\d+$/.test(pid)) {
        return `${pid}:null`;
    }

    // If it's just a number, add the prefix and suffix
    if (/^\d+$/.test(pid)) {
        return `pid:${pid}:null`;
    }

    // If it's in format "number:null", add the prefix
    if (/^\d+:null$/.test(pid)) {
        return `pid:${pid}`;
    }

    // For other formats, extract the numeric part and reformat
    let numericPart = pid;
    if (pid.includes(':')) {
        const parts = pid.split(':');
        const numericParts = parts.filter(part => /^\d+$/.test(part));
        if (numericParts.length > 0) {
            numericPart = numericParts[0];
        }
    }

    return `pid:${numericPart}:null`;
}
```

2. Updated all API methods to use the new formatter:
   - `getProductDetails`
   - `getProductVariants`
   - `getProductShipping`
   - `getProductComments`
   - `getSimilarProducts`
   - `getCompleteProductInformation` (which uses the above methods)

## Fix 2: URL Formatting

### Issue Details

API requests were failing with the error:
```
"Interface not found"
```

### Root Cause

The URL endpoints contained extra spaces, resulting in encoded URLs like:
```
https://developers.cjdropshipping.com/api2.0/v1%20/%20product%20/%20list%20?%20pageNum=1
```

### Solution Implemented

1. Removed all spaces from endpoint URLs in all API methods:
```javascript
// Before:
const endpoint = `v1 / product / list ? ${queryParams.toString()} `;

// After:
const endpoint = `v1/product/list?${queryParams.toString()}`;
```

2. Fixed all affected endpoints:
   - `v1/product/list`
   - `v1/product/query`
   - `v1/product/variant/query`
   - `v1/product/productComments`
   - `v1/product/similar`

## Fix 3: Double-Prefix Issue

### Issue Details

After deploying the initial ID format fix, we encountered a new issue where product imports were failing with:
```
"Failed to get product details: Failed to get product details: Product not found: pid:pid:2505100857261626000:null:null"
```

### Root Cause

The issue occurred because:

1. The product ID from the admin UI was already in the format `pid:NUMBER:null`
2. This ID was passed to the `getCompleteProductInformation` method
3. This method then passed the ID to other methods like `getProductDetails`, each of which applied the `formatProductId` method again
4. The `formatProductId` method wasn't handling this double-prefix case correctly

### Solution Implemented

1. Enhanced the `formatProductId` method to detect and fix double-prefixed IDs:
```javascript
// CRITICAL FIX: Check for double-prefixed IDs like "pid:pid:NUMBER:null" 
// and correct them instead of creating a triple-prefix
if (pid.startsWith('pid:pid:')) {
    const parts = pid.split(':');
    // Extract the numeric part (should be at index 2)
    if (parts.length >= 3 && /^\d+$/.test(parts[2])) {
        const formattedId = `pid:${parts[2]}:null`;
        console.log(`Fixed double-prefix in product ID: ${formattedId}`);
        return formattedId;
    }
}
```

2. **[NEW ENHANCEMENT] Completely redesigned API call flow to prevent double-formatting:**
   - Added separate internal methods that accept already-formatted product IDs
   - Modified `getCompleteProductInformation` to format the ID only once at the top level
   - Used the formatted ID for all subsequent API calls without reformatting
   - Added new methods:
     - `getProductDetailsWithRawPid`
     - `getProductVariantsWithRawPid`
     - `getProductCommentsWithRawPid`
     - `getSimilarProductsWithRawPid`

3. **[FURTHER ENHANCEMENT] Made "WithRawPid" methods publicly accessible:**
   - Renamed private methods with an underscore prefix (e.g. `_getProductDetailsWithRawPid`)
   - Created public wrapper methods to expose the internal implementations
   - Updated the import route to use these methods when available
   - Added fallback mechanism to work with older client versions

4. Added additional debugging in the import route handler:
```javascript
// DEBUGGING: Log the exact format of the product ID received
console.log('===== PRODUCT ID FORMAT DEBUGGING =====');
console.log(`Raw productId received: "${productId}"`);
console.log(`productId type: ${typeof productId}`);
console.log(`productId length: ${productId.length}`);
console.log(`productId starts with 'pid:': ${productId.startsWith('pid:')}`);
console.log(`productId includes double prefix: ${productId.includes('pid:pid:')}`);
```

This comprehensive solution ensures that:
1. Product IDs are formatted correctly at the initial API call
2. No subsequent formatting occurs that could create double-prefixing
3. Even if a double-prefixed ID somehow gets through, it will be properly handled
4. The router uses the proper methods that don't perform double-formatting

## Fix 4: Category Filtering Support

### Issue Details

The product search interface didn't support filtering products by CJ Dropshipping categories, forcing users to sift through all products or use only text-based searches.

### Root Cause

The integration was missing API support for fetching categories from CJ Dropshipping and applying them as filters during product searches.

### Solution Implemented

1. Added category fetching support through a dedicated API endpoint:
```javascript
// API route for fetching categories
export async function GET(request: NextRequest) {
    // Authentication and validation
    // ...

    // Create the CJ Dropshipping client
    const client = createSupplierApiClient({
        supplierId: supplier.id,
        apiKey: supplier.apiKey,
        apiEndpoint: supplier.apiEndpoint,
    }) as any;

    // Fetch categories from CJ Dropshipping
    const result = await client.getCategories();
    // ...
}
```

2. Implemented the `getCategories()` method in the client as an alias to maintain consistent naming:
```javascript
async getCategories(): Promise<any> {
    return this.getCategoryList();
}
```

3. Updated the product search interface to include category filtering:
```javascript
if (selectedCategory && selectedCategory !== "all") {
    params.append("categoryId", selectedCategory);
}
```

4. Added UI components for category selection with loading states and refresh capability.

## Fix 5: Bulk Import Functionality

### Issue Details

Users needed to import products one by one, which was time-consuming and inefficient when importing multiple products from CJ Dropshipping.

### Root Cause

The integration lacked a batch processing endpoint and UI functionality for importing multiple products at once.

### Solution Implemented

1. Created a dedicated bulk import API endpoint that processes products in batches:
```javascript
export async function POST(request: NextRequest) {
    // Authentication and validation
    // ...

    // Process the products in parallel with a limit to prevent rate limiting
    const importResults = [];
    const batchSize = 5; // Process 5 products at a time

    for (let i = 0; i < productIds.length; i += batchSize) {
        const batch = productIds.slice(i, i + batchSize);
        const batchPromises = batch.map(async (productId) => {
            try {
                // Product import logic
                // ...
            } catch (error) {
                // Error handling
                // ...
            }
        });

        // Wait for the current batch to complete
        const batchResults = await Promise.all(batchPromises);
        importResults.push(...batchResults);

        // Rate limiting prevention
        if (i + batchSize < productIds.length) {
            await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 1000));
        }
    }
}
```

2. Implemented consistent markup calculation across single and bulk imports:
```javascript
// Convert markup to a valid number
const markup = typeof rawMarkup === 'number' && !isNaN(rawMarkup) && rawMarkup >= 0 && rawMarkup <= 5
    ? rawMarkup
    : 0.3; // Default to 30% if invalid

// Calculate price with markup
const costPrice = parseFloat(product.sellPrice) || 0;
const markupMultiplier = 1 + markup; // Convert percentage to multiplier
const price = Math.ceil((costPrice * markupMultiplier) * 100) / 100; // Round up to nearest cent
```

3. Added UI functionality for product selection, including "Select All" and filtering out already imported products:
```javascript
// Toggle selection for all products
const toggleSelectAll = () => {
    if (selectedProducts.length === products.filter(p => !p.isImported).length) {
        setSelectedProducts([]);
    } else {
        // Only select products that haven't been imported yet
        setSelectedProducts(products.filter(p => !p.isImported).map(p => p.pid));
    }
};
```

4. Implemented a confirmation dialog and processing overlay for bulk imports:
```javascript
{showConfirm && (
    <div className="fixed inset-0 flex items-center justify-center z-50">
        <div className="fixed inset-0 bg-black/50" onClick={() => setShowConfirm(false)}></div>
        <div className="bg-white rounded-lg shadow-lg p-6 max-w-sm w-full relative z-10">
            <h3 className="text-lg font-medium mb-4">Confirm Bulk Import</h3>
            <p className="text-sm text-gray-500 mb-4">
                Are you sure you want to import {selectedProducts.length} product{selectedProducts.length !== 1 ? 's' : ''} with {markup}% markup?
            </p>
            <div className="flex justify-end space-x-2">
                <Button variant="outline" size="sm" onClick={() => setShowConfirm(false)}>
                    Cancel
                </Button>
                <Button size="sm" onClick={handleBulkImport} className="bg-primary text-white">
                    Confirm Import
                </Button>
            </div>
        </div>
    </div>
)}
```

5. Added a results display to show the outcome of each product import attempt.

## Testing and Verification

We created several test scripts to verify our fixes:

1. **Product ID Format Test** (`fix-cj-import-test.js`):
   - Tests different product ID formats
   - Verifies that all formats are correctly converted to `pid:NUMBER:null`

2. **URL Format Test** (`test-cj-url-fix.js`):
   - Verifies that API endpoint URLs are correctly formatted without spaces
   - Tests actual API calls to ensure they succeed

3. **Double-Prefix Test** (`test-format-product-id.js`):
   - Verifies that double-prefixed IDs are corrected
   - Tests edge cases like `pid:pid:NUMBER:null:null`

4. **Integration Test** (`src/test-cj-import.ts`):
   - Comprehensive test that verifies all fixes together
   - Tests product search, details, variants, and complete information

5. **Category Filtering Test** (`test-cj-category-filter.js`):
   - Verifies that products can be filtered by CJ Dropshipping categories
   - Tests category fetching and selection UI

6. **Bulk Import Test** (`test-cj-bulk-import.js`):
   - Tests importing multiple products at once
   - Verifies that markup is correctly applied and products are imported as expected

All tests pass successfully, confirming that our fixes have resolved the issues.
