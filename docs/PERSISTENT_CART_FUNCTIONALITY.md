# Persistent Cart Functionality Implementation

## Overview

The persistent cart functionality allows users' cart contents to be saved across sessions and devices, enabling customers to continue their checkout process later or on different devices. This is implemented through a synchronization system between browser storage and the database.

## Key Components

### 1. Cart Synchronization Hook (`use-cart-sync.ts`)

This hook manages bi-directional synchronization between the browser's local storage and the database:
- Loads cart from server on mount/session change
- Monitors local cart changes and syncs to server
- Manages cart ID for guest users via localStorage

### 2. Enhanced Cart Hook (`use-server-synced-cart.ts`)

This hook wraps standard cart functions with server-synced versions:
- Provides enhanced versions of `addItem`, `removeItem`, and `clearCart` that sync with the server
- Includes `syncCartWithServer` helper function to manually sync cart state

### 3. Cart Provider Component (`cart-provider.tsx`)

The CartProvider component initializes cart synchronization at the app level and is added to the main app layout.

### 4. Cart Drawer Updates (`cart-drawer.tsx`)

The cart drawer component has been updated to:
- Use the server-synced cart hook instead of accessing the local cart store directly
- Add loading indicators for cart operations
- Ensure cart operations (add, remove, update quantity, clear) sync with the server

## Testing

A test page has been created at `/test/cart-persistence` that allows you to:
1. Add test items to the cart
2. Check the current cart ID
3. Verify that cart contents persist across sessions
4. Test cart clearing functionality

## Implementation Details

### Client-Side Storage

- Cart items are stored locally using Zustand with persist middleware
- Cart ID is stored in localStorage under the key 'uniqverse-cart-id'

### Server-Side Storage

- Cart data is stored in the database based on the Prisma schema
- For logged-in users, the cart is associated with their user ID
- For guest users, a unique cart ID is generated and stored in localStorage

### Synchronization Process

1. When the app loads, it checks for existing cart data in localStorage
2. If a cart ID exists, it fetches the server-side cart and merges it with the local cart
3. Any changes to the cart (add, remove, update quantity) trigger a synchronization with the server
4. On checkout completion, the cart is cleared both locally and on the server

## User Experience Enhancements

- Loading indicators show when cart operations are in progress
- Cart operations first update the local state for immediate feedback, then sync with the server
- Error handling ensures the UI remains responsive even if server operations fail

## Testing Instructions

1. Visit the test page at `/test/cart-persistence`
2. Add items to your cart and note the Cart ID
3. Close the browser or open a new incognito window
4. Return to the site and verify that your cart items are still available
5. Test across different browsers and devices to ensure persistence works properly
