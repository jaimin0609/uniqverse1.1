# 3D Customization System - Final Validation Guide

## ✅ CRITICAL BUG FIX VERIFICATION

### Issue Fixed
- **Problem**: Infinite re-render loop in Radix UI Slider components
- **Cause**: State variables were arrays instead of numbers
- **Solution**: Changed slider state from `[value]` to `value` and properly handled array conversion

### Manual Testing Steps

#### 1. Load the Demo Page
- Navigate to: `http://localhost:3000/customizer-demo`
- **Expected**: Page loads without console errors
- **Check**: No "Maximum update depth exceeded" errors

#### 2. Test 3D Preview Controls
- Locate the 3D preview panel (right side)
- Test the following sliders:
  - **Camera Zoom**: Should move smoothly without errors
  - **Rotation Speed**: Should adjust auto-rotation speed
  - **Lighting**: Should change scene brightness
- **Expected**: All sliders respond smoothly without infinite loops

#### 3. Test Real-time Sync
- **Enable Sync**: Click the "Enable Real-time Sync" toggle
- **Add Text**: Add text in the 2D editor
- **Expected**: Text should appear on the 3D model texture in real-time
- **Add Shapes**: Add rectangles or circles
- **Expected**: Shapes should sync to 3D preview

#### 4. Test Design Tools
- **Text Tool**: Add custom text with different fonts/colors
- **Shape Tool**: Add rectangles and circles
- **Upload Tool**: Upload an image
- **Move/Resize**: Test element manipulation
- **Expected**: All tools work without errors

#### 5. Performance Test
- **Rapid Changes**: Make multiple quick changes in 2D editor
- **Expected**: System should throttle updates (150ms) without lag
- **Multiple Elements**: Add 10+ elements
- **Expected**: System remains responsive
