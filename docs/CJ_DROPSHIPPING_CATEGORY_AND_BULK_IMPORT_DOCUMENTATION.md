# CJ Dropshipping Category and Bulk Import Features

## Overview

This document outlines the implementation of two key features for the CJ Dropshipping integration:

1. **Category Filtering**: Fetch and display categories from the CJ Dropshipping API to allow filtering products by category
2. **Bulk Import Functionality**: Allow selecting and importing multiple products at once with consistent markup pricing

## Implementation Date

These features were implemented on [Current Date].

## Category Filtering Feature

### API Implementation

The category filtering feature utilizes the CJ Dropshipping API to fetch product categories and allow users to filter search results by category:

1. **Client Method**: Uses the `getCategories()` method in the `CJDropshippingApiClient` class
2. **API Endpoint**: `/api/admin/suppliers/cj-dropshipping/categories` returns the list of categories
3. **Search Integration**: Category filtering is implemented in the product search API by adding the `categoryId` parameter

### Frontend Implementation

The frontend implementation includes:

1. **Category Dropdown**: A dropdown menu that displays all available categories from CJ Dropshipping
2. **Loading State**: Visual indicator when categories are being loaded
3. **Refresh Button**: Allows manual refresh of categories
4. **Filter Application**: When a category is selected, it's applied to the search query, filtering products to that category

### Error Handling

Category fetching includes proper error handling for:
- Rate limiting by the CJ Dropshipping API
- Authentication failures
- Network errors
- Empty or invalid responses

## Bulk Import Feature

### API Implementation

The bulk import feature allows importing multiple products at once:

1. **Endpoint**: `/api/admin/suppliers/cj-dropshipping/bulk-import` handles bulk import requests
2. **Batch Processing**: Products are processed in batches to prevent rate limiting
3. **Consistent Pricing**: Uses the same markup calculation logic for both single and bulk imports
4. **Result Tracking**: Returns detailed results for each attempted product import

### Frontend Implementation

The frontend implementation includes:

1. **Product Selection**: Checkbox selection for individual products and "Select All" functionality
2. **Selection State**: Keeps track of selected products and excludes already imported ones
3. **Markup Control**: A slider to adjust markup percentage applied to all imported products
4. **Confirmation Dialog**: Requires confirmation before initiating bulk import
5. **Import Progress**: Visual feedback during the import process
6. **Results Display**: Shows the outcome of each product import attempt

### Data Model

Both features maintain consistent data structures:

1. **Categories**:
```typescript
interface Category {
    id: string;
    name: string;
    slug: string;
}
```

2. **Products**:
```typescript
interface CJProduct {
    pid: string;
    productNameEn: string;
    productImage: string;
    sellPrice: number;
    shippingTime?: string;
    variants?: any[];
    isImported?: boolean;
}
```

## Usage Instructions

### Category Filtering

1. Open the CJ Dropshipping product import page
2. Wait for categories to load or click the refresh button
3. Select a category from the dropdown
4. Search to filter products by that category

### Bulk Import

1. Search for products using any filters or search terms
2. Select individual products using checkboxes or use "Select All"
3. Adjust the markup percentage as needed
4. Click "Import Selected" to begin the import process
5. Confirm when prompted
6. Wait for the import process to complete
7. Review the results displayed on the page

## Technical Considerations

- **Rate Limiting**: Both features implement backoff strategies to handle CJ Dropshipping API rate limits
- **Error Resilience**: The bulk importer continues processing other products even if some imports fail
- **UI/UX**: Loading states, confirmation dialogs, and results displays provide feedback to the user
- **Markup Consistency**: The same markup calculation is used for both single and bulk imports

## Future Improvements

Potential enhancements for these features include:

1. **Category Caching**: Store categories in local storage to reduce API calls
2. **Import Queue**: Allow queueing imports for later processing
3. **Retry Mechanism**: Add ability to retry failed imports automatically
4. **Import Templates**: Save markup and category combinations as templates
5. **Advanced Filtering**: Combine category filtering with other filters like price range

## Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions:

1. **Categories Not Loading**: Check network connection and API rate limits
2. **Bulk Import Failures**: Review error messages in the results display
3. **Slow Import Processing**: Reduce batch size or try importing fewer products at once
