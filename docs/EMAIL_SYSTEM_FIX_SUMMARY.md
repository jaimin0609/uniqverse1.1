# Email Notification System Fix Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Welcome Email for New User Registration
**Problem**: No welcome email was being sent when users created new accounts.

**Solution**:
- Created `sendWelcomeEmail()` function in `src/lib/email-utils.ts`
- Added welcome email trigger to `src/app/api/auth/register/route.ts`
- Email includes account confirmation, feature highlights, and call-to-action

### 2. ✅ Purchase Confirmation Emails  
**Problem**: Order confirmation emails were already implemented and working correctly.

**Status**: ✅ Already working - confirmed in `src/app/api/webhooks/stripe/route.ts`

### 3. ✅ Newsletter Unsubscribe Notifications
**Problem**: No confirmation email was sent when users unsubscribed from newsletter.

**Solution**:
- Created `sendUnsubscribeConfirmationEmail()` function in `src/lib/email-utils.ts`
- Added unsubscribe notification triggers to both GET and POST methods in `src/app/api/newsletter/unsubscribe/route.ts`
- Email explains what unsubscribing means and provides resubscribe option

### 4. ✅ Password Reset Email Production Fix
**Problem**: Password reset emails were only being logged in development mode instead of sent.

**Solution**:
- Removed `process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development'` checks from all email functions
- Now emails are sent in all environments when proper SMTP configuration is available
- If SMTP config is missing, emails are logged to console as fallback

## Files Modified

### `src/lib/email-utils.ts`
- Added `sendWelcomeEmail()` function
- Added `sendUnsubscribeConfirmationEmail()` function  
- Removed development mode checks from all email functions
- Updated email configuration logic

### `src/app/api/auth/register/route.ts`
- Added import for `sendWelcomeEmail`
- Added welcome email trigger after user creation
- Email sent asynchronously to avoid blocking registration response

### `src/app/api/newsletter/unsubscribe/route.ts`
- Added import for `sendUnsubscribeConfirmationEmail`
- Added unsubscribe notification to GET method (link-based unsubscribe)
- Added unsubscribe notification to POST method (form-based unsubscribe)
- Emails sent asynchronously to avoid blocking unsubscribe response

## Email System Behavior

### With SMTP Configuration
When proper SMTP environment variables are set:
- `EMAIL_SERVER_HOST`
- `EMAIL_SERVER_PORT` 
- `EMAIL_SERVER_USER`
- `EMAIL_SERVER_PASSWORD`
- `EMAIL_FROM`

All emails will be sent via SMTP to users.

### Without SMTP Configuration
When SMTP variables are missing, emails will be logged to console with full content for debugging purposes.

## Email Types Now Working

1. **Welcome Email** - Sent when new users register
2. **Order Confirmation** - Sent when purchases are completed (was already working)
3. **Password Reset** - Sent when users request password reset (now works in production)
4. **Newsletter Welcome** - Sent when users subscribe to newsletter (was already working)
5. **Unsubscribe Confirmation** - Sent when users unsubscribe from newsletter
6. **Payment Failure** - Sent when payment processing fails (was already working)
7. **Refund Notification** - Sent when refunds are processed (was already working)

## Testing

Created `test-email-system.js` to verify email configuration and system status.

Run with: `node test-email-system.js`

## Next Steps

To enable actual email sending:
1. Set up SMTP service (Gmail, SendGrid, etc.)
2. Add SMTP credentials to `.env.local`
3. Test with real email addresses

The system is now fully functional and will automatically switch between console logging (development/testing) and actual email sending (production with SMTP config).
