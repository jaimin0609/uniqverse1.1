## ‚ö†Ô∏è Risk Assessment

### High-Risk Cost Areas

| Risk Area | Probability | Impact | Mitigation Strategy |
|-----------|-------------|--------|-------------------|
| **AI API Costs** | Medium | High | Usage caps, monitoring, fallbacks |
| **Traffic Spikes** | High | Medium | Auto-scaling, CDN, caching |
| **Payment Processing** | Low | Medium | Multiple providers, fraud prevention |
| **Database Performance** | Medium | Medium | Query optimization, read replicas |

### Cost Spike Scenarios

1. **Viral Product Launch**
   - **Risk**: 10x traffic increase
   - **Cost Impact**: +$500-1000/month temporarily
   - **Mitigation**: Auto-scaling limits, CDN caching

2. **AI Token Abuse**
   - **Risk**: Automated attacks or loops
   - **Cost Impact**: +$200-500/month
   - **Mitigation**: Rate limiting, user authentication

3. **Database Connection Limits**
   - **Risk**: Connection pool exhaustion
   - **Cost Impact**: Forced upgrade, +$50-100/month
   - **Mitigation**: Connection optimization, monitoring

### Contingency Planning

```typescript
interface EmergencyProcedures {
  costThresholds: {
    warning: 150,     // % of budget
    critical: 200,    // % of budget
    emergency: 300    // % of budget
  },
  responses: {
    warning: "Increase monitoring, optimize queries",
    critical: "Enable cost caps, disable non-essential features",
    emergency: "Activate emergency shutdown procedures"
  }
}
```
